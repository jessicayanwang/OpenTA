## Problem Set 1: Introduction to C

## DUE DATE
September 15, 2024 at 11:59 PM EST

## OVERVIEW
This problem set will introduce you to programming in C. You'll implement several programs that demonstrate basic programming concepts.

## GETTING STARTED
1. Log into CS50 IDE
2. Run `update50` to update your IDE
3. Create a directory called `pset1`
4. Navigate to that directory

## PROBLEM 1: HELLO
Implement a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.

Requirements:
- File name: hello.c
- Must compile without errors
- Output must match exactly: "Hello, World!\n"

## PROBLEM 2: MARIO
Implement a program that prints a half-pyramid of a specified height using hashes (#).

Requirements:
- Prompt user for height (between 1 and 8, inclusive)
- If invalid input, re-prompt
- Print right-aligned pyramid

Example output for height 4:
   #
  ##
 ###
####

## PROBLEM 3: CREDIT
Implement a program that determines whether a credit card number is valid using Luhn's algorithm.

Requirements:
- Prompt user for credit card number
- Validate using Luhn's algorithm
- Identify card type: AMEX, MASTERCARD, VISA, or INVALID
- Print the card type

## SUBMISSION
Submit your code via `submit50 cs50/problems/2024/x/pset1`

Make sure all programs compile and run correctly before submitting. Test with the provided check50 tool.

## GRADING RUBRIC
Each problem is worth equal points:
- Correctness: 70%
- Design: 20%
- Style: 10%

## GETTING HELP
If you're stuck:
1. Review lecture notes and shorts
2. Post on Ed Discussion (no code sharing!)
3. Attend office hours
4. Use the debugger to step through your code

Remember: The goal is to learn, not just to complete the assignment. Take your time and understand each concept.
